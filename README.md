# Recipe-CLI

In this project, we're going to use these skills to create a CLI. We want you to display knowledge of as much from Phase 3 as you can- you won't be able to fit everything in, but we'll expect to see:

A CLI application that solves a real-world problem and adheres to best practices.
A database created and modified with SQLAlchemy ORM with 3+ related tables.
A well-maintained virtual environment using Pipenv.
Proper package structure in your application.
Use of lists, dicts, and tuples.
Appropriate and accurate implementation of an algorithm from the Data Structures and Algorithms Canvas module.
